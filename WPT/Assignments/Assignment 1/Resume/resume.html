        <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><B>Brain tumor detectionAndroid App: - </B>I led a significant project in which I have developed a Brain Tumor Detection 
                Android App using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The primary goal of this endeavor was to assist medical 
                professionals in accurately and swiftly identifying the presence of brain tumors in MRI images
            </li>

            <li><B>Age, gender prediction: -</B>-In this project, I applied advanced data science techniques to predict the age and gender 
                of individuals based on various demographic features and facial images, I developed a predictive model that 
                accurately determines the age group and gender of a person from a given dataset.
                
            </li>

            <li><B>Color detection system: -</B>- In this project, I implemented image processing techniques and data analysis to accurately 
                identify and classify colors within images. Leveraging Python programming and libraries such as OpenCV and scikitlearn, I developed an algorithm that could distinguish a wide range of colors based on their RGB values. The project 
                involved preprocessing images, extracting color features, and training machine learning models for color
